## My first React Application

I made it with class components, to practice OOP.

**What I use :**
 1. Create-react-app—easiest way to create React app.
 2. Bootstrap – for simple styles.
 3. React 18.2.0.
 4. Gh-pages 4.0 – to deploy correctly.
 5. Fontawesome

**Application features:**

 - [x] Counters for employees
 - [x] Search bar and filters
 - [x] Workers list with opportunity to change his status
 - [x] Adding form
